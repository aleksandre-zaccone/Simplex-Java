# **Overview of IntelliJ IDEA**

IntelliJ IDEA is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for JVM languages to enhance developer productivity. It automates routine tasks with clever code completion, static code analysis, and refactoring, allowing you to focus on the positive aspects of software development, making it not just efficient, but also enjoyable.

# **Multi-platform Support**

IntelliJ IDEA is a cross-platform IDE providing a consistent experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The easiest way is to use [JetBrains Toolbox]( https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)

- For Windows - run the installer and follow the wizard steps.
- For MacOS - mount the image and drag the JetBrains Toolbox app to the Applications folder.
- For Linux - Extract the tarball to a directory that supports file execution. For example, if the downloaded version is 1.17.7391, you can extract it to the recommended /opt directory using the following command:
``` bash
sudo tar -xzf jetbrains-toolbox-1.17.7391.tar.gz -C /opt
```
Execute the jetbrains-toolbox binary from the extracted directory to run the Toolbox App.

# **Supported Languages**

IntelliJ IDEA is designed for JVM languages ([Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)) but can support multiple languages, tools, frameworks, and technologies through plugins.

# **IntelliJ IDEA Editions**

IntelliJ IDEA comes in two editions:

- [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/): A full-featured Java and Kotlin IDE with support for other languages, server-side and front-end frameworks, databases, profiling tools, and more.
- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=linux): A free IDE with essential features for Java and Kotlin enthusiasts.

You can compare editions using the [IntelliJ IDEA editions comparison matrix](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html).
I recommend Ultimate edition because it has some additional everyday features like:
- SQL, Hibernate, JPA, Database Tools - this help you work with databases from IntelliJ 
- HTTP Client - you can call endpoints directly from IntelliJ
- [Profiling tools](https://lp.jetbrains.com/intellij-idea-profiler) - you profile an application without leaving the IDE.
- Thymeleaf, Freemarker, React, React Native - support fronted languages
- Settings synchronization via JetBrains Account - you can synchronize almost all settings between your machines under the same account
