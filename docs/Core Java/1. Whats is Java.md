# **Whats is Java**

Java is a widely used, object-orienting, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation).

Java is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that programs written in Java can run on different operating systems without modification.

__Key features and characteristics of Java include__:

- **Object-Oriented:** Java is based on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which means it organizes code into reusable, modular units called objects. OOP promotes code organization, re-usability, and ease of maintenance.
<br>
- **Platform Independence:** Java applications are compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows Java programs to run on different operating systems without modification.
<br>
- **Strongly Typed:** Java enforces strict type-checking, which helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This enhances code reliability and reduces unexpected errors.
<br>
- **Garbage Collection:** Java includes automatic memory management through garbage collection, which helps manage memory and deallocates memory resources for objects that are no longer in use.
<br>
- **Multi-Threaded:** Java supports multi-threading, allowing developers to create applications that can perform multiple tasks concurrently. This is particularly useful for tasks like handling user interfaces and managing concurrent network connections.
<br>
- **Rich Standard Library:** Java comes with a comprehensive standard library (Java Standard Library or Java API) that provides a wide range of pre-built classes and methods for common programming tasks, such as data structures, input/output, networking, and more.
<br>
- **Security:** Java has built-in security features, such as sandboxing, which restricts the actions of potentially malicious code, making it a popular choice for building secure applications.
